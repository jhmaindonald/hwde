Title: Models and Tests for Departure from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
  and Independence Between Loci
Author: John Maindonald, with \code{hwexact()} from Randall Johnson.
Maintainer: John Maindonald <jhmaindonald@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.0)
Description: Fits models for genotypic disequilibria, as described in
  Huttley and Wilson (2000) <doi:10.1093/genetics/156.4.2127>, Weir (1996) and Weir and Wilson (1986).
  Contrast terms are available that account for first order interactions
  between loci.  Also implements, for a single locus in a single
  population, a conditional exact test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
